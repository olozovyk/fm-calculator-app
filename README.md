# Frontend Mentor - Calculator App

This is a solution to the [Calculator app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/calculator-app-9lteq5N29). This project is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and was bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Features

- Supports basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Works with negative numbers and decimal values.
- Keyboard support for easier input.
- Three themes: light, dark, and colorful.
- Smooth transitions and transformations for theme switching.

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying [`app/page.tsx`](app/page.tsx). The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
